				<h2> Summary of Findings </h2>
				<div class="summary">
					<p> In my research I found that there were two sections that users consistently valued above all others in a personal portfolio website: 
						the "About Me" section and the "Resume" section. This is to be expected, as the point of a personal portfolio website is to gain 
						employment, and hiring managers rely heavily on past experience when deciding which candidate they will accept for a job. In fact, in my
						2 question test case 7/10 people said that the most important section of a personal profile website is the "About Me" section. The biggest challenge
						was probably getting my testers to stay on topic. In my one click test when one tester was asked why he/she clicked on a specific area, 
						their response was "why not". Another test response in my 2 question test case was even more off-topic which lead to my having to re-do the 
						entire test and ask people who had already answered to anwer again. It is possible that such an action may have skewed the results of the test,
						so in the future I will try to be more careful to cearly convey the purpose of the test such that it does not get misunderstood. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The research exercises helped me understand how nuanced testing can be. As discussed in the class, many times people will have 
						their own opinion about what ought to go in a product. Trying to implement everything you hear from user testing can be damaging and 
						result in an even worse product down the road. If there are certain features, however, that are mentioned a signifcant amount of time by the
						users (particularly if they mention those features without being asked about them directly) then that is a good sign that said features are
						worth looking into. Overall this process has helped me understand how useful testing can be when improving a website. I learned that many of the
						steps in the User Research and User Testing stages actually complement each other very well. Since this was my first time trying user research,
						I did not really go back and update my documents after conducting user testing. In future projects where user research and testing is
						essential, I would update my user research documents with each testing phase. This would allow me to have more relevant documents and improve my 
						interface with features that people actually want to see.

				<div class="interviews">
					<p> For my User Interviews, I spoke to people who either currently work in the Computer Science field
						or hope to do so in the future. Since my portfolio website will be primarily aimed at the Computer Science
						field, I thought that this would be the best demographic to target in my user interviews. I asked a few questions
						regarding their goals and aspirations for the future in order to provide context for my final questions. What I 
						found was that the majority of the people I interviewed are primarily looking for relevant content and do not place
						as much emphasis on the aesthetic of the website as I had thought. Although having an aesthetic website is a nice perk,
						and it is of course important to have good usability and responsive designlo, my user interviews have lead me to 
						believe the content of the website is what matters the most. Particularly, users are looking to find previous works and
						links to those works.

				</div>
				<div class="analysis">
					<p> A competitor analysis is an evaluation of how others in the same industry are doing something. In this case, I took a look at the
					    personal portfolio websites of other people in the Computer Science field. This would allow me to see what features other programmers
						believe are valuable. Particularly, I decided to investigate those high profile websites that stand out among Google searches, 
						to see what exactly it is that sets them apart. I did not find a concrete answer to this question. That is to say, there is no one 
						thing that I can point to and say that this feature is present in every website. In fact, one competitor, Robby Leonardi, did not have any sort
						of navigation in his website. In his case such a feature may have defeated the purpose of his website, but personal preference does play a 
						part as well, particularly when the website is so personal in nature. If I had to pick one consistency among all websites however it would have 
						to be solid, informative content that answered important questions a user may have about the programmer who made it, and links to previous works.

				</div>
				<div class="value matrix">
					<p> The feature value matrix maps the proposed features of a product to their business value, user value, and developmental effort.
						The matrix allows the developers to evaluate whether or not a feature is truly needed and which features should be developed first.
						I chose the features that I believed would be most essential in a personal profile. These are basic features such as a contact form and 
						a navigation menu which add usability and substance to the website. I rated the development effort and business value of these features 
						based on my own ability to implement them and on what I percieved their value to be from my research so, as I gain more experience and conduct
						further research, these values may change. For the time being, however, I believe they are a good representation of what a portfolio website 
						needs to have.

				</div>
				
				<div class="prioritization">
					<p> I prioritized the features I decided to include based on the value matrix mentioned above. The lower the total value of a feature, the more
						important such a feature is. When building an interface following the proper design steps I would have conducted the feature prioritization 
						before beginning to work on my project. Therefore, before I begin work I would think about creating a roadmap in which I can organize which features 
						I want to implement and at what point in the development process I want to do so. This way I can finish some features and have them tested in
						order to see if they require any changes before moving on to the next set of features. I would continue this proecess until I have implemented all 
						my features and, by the time I finish building my interface, I would have tested all of my features multiple times.
					</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="stories">
					<p> User stories provide several benefits to the development process. They are useful for planning out features that need to be built. Another 
						advantage that user stories bring to the table is that they are generally very straightforward. It's easy to get bogged down in details during
						development and lose sight of the end goal. User stories help bring the focus back to what the feature is meant to accomplish. My website is a personal 
						portfolio website so the primary users would be potential employers and hiring managers. I created most of my user stories with that user in mind. 
						What would a hiring manager want to do when visiting my personal portfolio website? Likely, he or she would want to find my information, past work, and 
						some way to contact me. For the sake of diversity, I also included other users like friends or advertisers, who might want to show off my website 
						if they come across an opportunity that may be of interest to me. These kinds of users should also know how my website works and what to look for.
					</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="cognitive">
					<p> A cognitive walkthrough is a method used to measure the usability of an interface. In this case I asked some users to go through some tasks
						on the website and answer some questions about what they were doing. The goal of a cognitive walkthrough is to understand how intutitive an
						interface is for new users. One challenge I faced while conducting these tests was conveying that the users were supposed to use only the website
						in order to solve the questions I asked. This taught me that my website was lacking in information. It is also important to remember that the answers
						given by the users are, in the end, just their opinions and should not be taken as written in stone. Two of the answers given by users I tested 
						were completely opposite. In conclusion, we should treat the answers from cognitive walkthroughs more as suggestions to be investigated rather than
						final answers to be implemented right away.
					</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="user">
					<p> For the user tests I chose to conduct a one-click test and a 2 question test. I chose these tests primarily because of their simplicity in both
						administering and in completing. Most of the people I tested were college age students, since I did not have access to other testers. In general, 
						I believe that shorter, more concise tests are more effective because they only require a shorter, simpler answer which even testers with small
						attention spans can provide. Particularly in the college age demographic where testers are generally on the go a lot and have little patience for long,
						drawn out tests. In fact, because of this demographic it was challenging getting real responses, since a few people did not take the tests
						seriously and decided to troll and put random answers instead. Overall, however, the results were about what I expected. The one-click test was fairly easy
						and most people got it. The ones that didn't unsurprisngly, said they clicked too fast and skipped over the directions. In terms of the question test,
						most people had the same answers for both questions which is a good indication for potential steps in improving the website.

				<div class="incorporation">
				<h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>
					<p> I would begin incorporating my findings by creating a timeline for my project which would be based primarily around my feature prioritization graph and
						the Kano model. As soon as I finish implementing a few features and have an interface that is usable, I would go into testing in order to get feedback on the
						features I implemented. For my current portfolio website, some of the most common feedback I got was on creating a more professional background and resizing or
						replacing my images with clearer ones. This is a fairly simple fix so I would begin there. The next piece of important feedback I got was that I needed more 
						personal information. To this end I would add another section to my portfolio where I would list my skills and previous job positions. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Once I finished making all the changes that I had planned and implemented all the features on my feature value matrix, I would look towards my competitor
						analysis to see what other features top competitors have that could be of benefit to my website. I am expecting that these features would involve greater 
						development time because of my current skills, but would allow me to create a more aesthetically pleasing website while also gaining more HTML/CSS/Javascript
						experience.
